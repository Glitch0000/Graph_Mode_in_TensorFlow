# Graph_Mode_in_TensorFlow
Graphs are data structures that contain a set of tf.Operation objects, which represent units of computation; and tf.Tensor objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a tf.Graph context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code. The steps are:  loading batches, calculating gradients, updating parameters, calculating validation accuracy, repeating the loop until convergence.
